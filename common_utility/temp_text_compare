A French couple who boarded the Concordia in Marseille claim they saw the captain, covered in a blanket, fleeing the sinking vessel on a lifeboat, according to The Associated Press.

Francesco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, could be slapped with manslaughter charges after the cruise ship hit rocks near the island of Giglio on Friday, authorities said.

The captain of a doomed luxury liner that struck a reef off the coast of Italy faces charges he abandoned his ship, leaving passengers and crew behind in the sinking wreckage.

âThe commander left before and was on the dock before everyone was off,â said Ophelie Gondelle, 28, a French military officer. âNormally the commander should leave at the end.â

âWe were the last to leave the ship,â he told told Italian news channel Tgcom24.

Authorities are investigating. According to Italian navigation code, a captain who abandons ship before others are safe can face up to 12 years in prison, AP reported.

At least five people are confirmed dead, and another 30 were injured when the Costa Concordia slammed into the reef. A 160-foot gash split open the ship's hull, causing it to take on water and quickly list to starboard, preventing many of its lifeboats from being launched.

Two of the victims were French, the third a crewman from Peru, AP reported.

As many as 4,200 people were aboard the luxury liner, including 126 Americans.

An unidentified person -- believed to be an Italian crewmember -- was lifted out via helicopter on Sunday. Searchers are desperately racing to locate more than a dozen other passengers and crewmembers still unaccounted missing.

It is unclear why the vessel got so close to the shore.

Schettino claims that nautical charts did not indicate there were potentially dangerous rocks in the area.

âWe were navigating approximately 300 meters from the rocks,â he told Mediaset television, according to AP. âThere shouldnât have been such a rock.â

Divers recovered the ship's "black box," which records the navigational information, and authorities hope it will help shed more light on what happened.
